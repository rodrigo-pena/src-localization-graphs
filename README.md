# src-localization-graphs
Implementation of algorithms for source localization on graphs via l1 regularization and spectral graph theory.

## Installation
First, make sure to download and install the [GSPBox](https://lts2.epfl.ch/gsp/), and [MatlabBGL](http://dgleich.github.io/matlab-bgl/). Then, in MATLAB, just change the current directory to the src-localization-graphs folder and run src\_loc\_start.m to add the needed dependencies to path.

If you want to work with John Snow's GIS data, and the ETEX data (see paper in the References section below), you will need to download and install the [load-data](https://github.com/rodrigo-pena/load-data) toolbox.
